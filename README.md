# Bone-Fracture-Detection

Bone fracture detection is crucial in medical diagnostics, traditionally relying on manual examination of X-ray images by radiologists. However, this approach can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, often varying based on the radiologist's experience. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative solution that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning technique, to automatically detect bone fractures from X-ray images. By training the CNN model on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images, the system learns to identify complex fracture patterns with high accuracy. This automated approach not only improves diagnostic efficiency and consistency but also reduces reliance on human interpretation. Our solution offers early detection, consistent performance, and potential cost savings in healthcare by accelerating the diagnostic process. With further optimization and validation, this system can revolutionize medical imaging, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
